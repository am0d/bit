h1. Overview

buildit is an easy to use, easy to modify, and easy to understand build system.
It supports dependency tracking, multiple projects, and an easy to use API.

h1. Information

Currently only python 2.6.x is supported, though there are plans to add in Python 3.x support. No python versions before that will be supported. buildit is not guaranteed to run on other Python implementations.

h2. Installation Instructions

To install buildit, merely run @python setup.py install@ in your favorite shell

h2. Building The Documentation

(Expect this to change at some point, as Sphinx is expected to replace the current documentation system, which was a quick hack anyways)

To build the documentation "PyTextile":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/textile is required. In the doc directory, just run @build.py@. This will create an html folder one level up from the doc folder. The tutorial is located in the documentation.
