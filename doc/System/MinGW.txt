# Module: MinGW


## Description

`MinGW` is a modified version of `Unix`. The only difference is it has the ability to compile resource files (`.rc` extension) with the use of the `resource` function.

## Functions

#### resource
parameters: `file_name` 

description: Compiles the given `.rc` file and places the resulting object file in the `_link_list`. (There is currently a bug, that manifests on a first run where the `rc` file is not compiled at all. Running the script a second time removes this problem.)
