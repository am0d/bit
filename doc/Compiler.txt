System Module
=============
Tres Walsh <tres.walsh@mnmlstc.com>

Description
-----------
Compiler is the base for all compilers. It defines a few abstract methods, as well as setting some default behaviors so in the event of an error in a child class the entire program won't throw an exception.

Initialization
--------------
To change a system's compiler merely set it with `System.compiler = <Compiler>()`
An example would be

`x.compiler = CXX()`

Make sure to only set the compiler before adding any information to the System.

Arguments
---------
Compiler doesn't not take any public arguments, although you're welcome to place the project name in it's contructor (Although it will be automatically set by the parent `System`)
