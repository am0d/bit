# Unix

## Description

`Unix` is based off of `System`, and is used for `cc` based compilers. This includes `gcc`. This is where a majority of C and C++ code are mentioned.

## Functions

#### pkg_config
parameters: `package`, `script` (pkg)

description: allows the use of the `pkg-config` (or any other scripts such as `sdl-config` from inside the build script without having to call it yourself. The resulting text is automatically added to the system's compile and link steps.

#### add_define
parameters: `define`

description: adds a define to the compiler (in this case, it is `-D<define>`)

## Properties

#### C99
type: `get`

description: Calling `Unix.C99` sets a few basic calls to ensure that the C99 standard is used (this is not by default). It is not a function, and does not return anything.

#### enable_c
type: `get`

description: Calling `Unix.enable_c` will allow the use of C files with a CXX compiler.
