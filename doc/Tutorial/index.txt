## Overview
<a name="overview"></a>
This tutorial was written to provide you, the user, with the basics required to utilize buildit in your build system. 

## Requirements
<a name="requirements"><a/>
A basic [CPython](http://python.org "Python") or [IronPython](http://ironpython.net "IronPython") 2.6 installation is all that is required. There are plans to eventually port buildit to Python 3, however, nothing before Python 2.6 will be targeted.

## Installation
<a name="installation"></a>
From a commandline (with administrative rights), running `setup.py install` will be sufficient to install buildit. If you are on Windows, and prefer to not use the commandline, placing buildit in your `<Python Installation>/Lib/site-packages/` directory will suffice.
