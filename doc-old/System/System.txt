h1. System

h2. Description

@System@ is the base "project" class in buildit. If you are implementing new language support then you should derive from @System@. Otherwise, it is best to implement a new @Compiler@, or to derive from another @System@ such as @MSVC@ or @Unix@. 

h2. Functions

h4. add

parameters: @files@

description: Autoglobs directories, or adds a file to the compiler list. Adds files with the compiler's @extensions@ property. Uses var args.

h4. remove

parameters: @files@

description: Works in the opposite way of @System.add@, by removing files from the compiler list.

h4. require

parameters: @System@

description: Used to ensure a series of builds are run in order. If the given @System@ fails to complete properly, the original @System@ using require will not build. This command is useful for stringing several projects together.

h4. append

parameters: @function@

description: Places the given @function@ after the compiler's run step. Useful if a post build step is required.

h4. prepend

parameters: @function@

description: Places the given @function@ before the compiler's run step. Useful for creating prebuild steps.
