# Module: System

## Description

`System` is the base "project" class in buildit. If you are implementing new language support then you should derive from `System`. Otherwise, it is best to implement a new `Compiler`, or to derive from another `System` such as `MSVC` or `Unix`. 

## Functions

#### add
parameters: `files`, `recurse` (False)

description: Takes a list, directory, and adds it to the list of files to be compiled. set recurse to true to autoglob the directory and all subdirectories (backend may change in future versions)

#### remove
parameters: `files`

description: Takes a list, directory, or filename, and removes it from the list of files to be compiled.
